  description: "They say that every ritual of the ancestors shows them how much you
    respect them, and they thank you. I don't know how true this is, but the smoke
    from the tent makes you more confident and less cautious. \n\nIf you have produced
    fart powder or vision charms on the day, the damage increases accordingly."
