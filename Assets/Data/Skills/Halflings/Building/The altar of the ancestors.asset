  description: 'The shaman asks you to build a special monument where everyone can
    bring gifts for the spirits of their ancestors, and he, as an intermediary between
    the ancestors and the faithful, will take them for himself. You do agree to a
    percentage of the offerings.


    Every day he gives you some random resources.'
