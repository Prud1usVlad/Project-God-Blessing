  description: "One day a shaman called you over and showed you a strange brownish
    substance, and after listening to a long story you realized that it was a special
    mixture used in festive rituals, and today was the right time for it. After coming
    to your senses a few days later, you realized that the product has prospects
    in the market. \n\nIt allows you to produce the charms of visions in a shaman."
