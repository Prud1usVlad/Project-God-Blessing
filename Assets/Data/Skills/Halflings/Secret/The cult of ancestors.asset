  description: "You may or may not believe in ancestral spirits, we don't care, but
    people keep coming to the altar. It should be improved, then maybe the gifts
    will be more valuable. And then send missionaries to the neighboring villages,
    although what can these ragamuffins bring? \n\nIt makes it possible to improve
    the altar, which increases the likelihood of receiving expensive gifts. With
    distribution, the number of gifts will increase significantly, but without better
    resources."
