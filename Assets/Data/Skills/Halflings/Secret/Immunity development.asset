  description: 'Poison is a common thing in the distant lands of the haflings, so
    everyone there develops immunity to it from childhood, which is why they offer
    to teach you. But some of your friends who are doctors can improve this method
    significantly, but who knows if they will tell your enemies about it.


    It
    reduces the duration of the poison''s effect. If spread, it gives complete immunity
    to the poison, but its effect on enemies will be reduced.'
