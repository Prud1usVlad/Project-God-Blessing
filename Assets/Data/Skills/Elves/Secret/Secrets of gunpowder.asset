  description: "So all this time your alchemists could have been supplying you with
    gunpowder? Hurry up and go make some pyrotechnics. If you can't or don't want
    to make the bundles, teach others, but don't be surprised when the explosions
    don't scare anyone anymore. \n\nAllows you to produce gunpowder in the laboratory.
    When distributed, the cost of resources for a pyrotechnician is significantly
    reduced, but the debuff time from explosions is reduced."
