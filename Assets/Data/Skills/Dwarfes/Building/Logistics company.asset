  description: "Some warmed-over dwarves offer you to host their logistics company's
    warehouse, and in return they will leave some boxes for you. They say it often
    happens that during the delivery the customer is no longer alive. It's a strange
    thing, but they are obliged to leave the boxes regularly, and no one will know
    what will be in the boxes until they are opened.  \n\nIt allows you to receive
    deliveries of random goods for gold."
