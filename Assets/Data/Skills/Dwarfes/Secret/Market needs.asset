  description: "Lately, you've been having drinks with a banker from the city, and
    he talks a lot about new trends in the market, and you manage to copy a few specialized
    machines from his stories that you don't have a license for. This can be used
    for advertising, but if someone finds out, your production license may be restricted. 
    \n\nA weaving workshop can now produce rope and copper wire. When distributed,
    the weaving workshop's production is limited, but the price of the products increases."
