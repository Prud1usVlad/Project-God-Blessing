  description: "Your friends introduce you to the city bureaucracy, and now you are
    better oriented and can solve problems better. And you think you can develop
    a small guide with tips for others, which would be good for making money, but
    your assistant confidently says that in this case you should wait for the tax
    office.  \n\nGives one point of charisma. When distributed, it gives you another
    point, but all the gold is deducted from your account."
