  description: 'Some strange and noisy old man with a stick was shouting in front
    of the tavern that he would poison all the horses in the stable if they didn''t
    give him a drink. For some reason, instead of slapping him in the face, you invited
    him to settle here and work for you.


    He produces poison and ancestral powder.'
