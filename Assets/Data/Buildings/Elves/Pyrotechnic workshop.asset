  description: "They say there is a strange elf hiding nearby, they say he is not
    completely insane, but he produces powerful weapons that can hit enemies even
    without a direct hit. Perhaps you should give him shelter, but then don't be
    surprised when half of your settlement flies into the sky.   \n\nFor the resources
    it allows you to create powerful elven weapons."
