  description: "A group of orcs have found an abandoned mine in the mountains nearby,
    so they're asking for a storage and transportation area, with the possibility
    of buying resources from them at low prices. It sounds like a plan, as long as
    you don't steal from them  \n\nProduces coal, sulfur, iron and copper ore, for
    a lot of money."
