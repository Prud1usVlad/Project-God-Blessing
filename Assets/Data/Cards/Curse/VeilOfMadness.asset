  prophesies:
  - When the Veil of Madness descends, the line between reason and chaos shall blur,
    and your mind shall become a battleground of nightmarish delusions.
  - 'Under the Veil of Madness, reality shall warp and contort, and the world around
    you shall become a grotesque carnival of hallucinations and phantoms. '
  - 'The curse shall plunge you into the abyss of insanity, where the shrieks of
    your own thoughts shall deafen your soul, and each moment shall be a descent
    into the depths of madness. '
  - 'As the Veil of Madness enshrouds you, your own reflection shall become a tormentor,
    mocking your sanity as it twists and distorts in the shattered mirror of your
    mind.  '
  - 'The Veil of Madness shall be a relentless storm of fractured perceptions, where
    reason is a fragile ember in a tempest of chaos, and your grasp on reality shall
    slip through trembling fingers. '
