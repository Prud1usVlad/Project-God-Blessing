  prophesies:
  - When the Veil descends, shadows shall dance to the tune of fading stars, and
    the world will be cloaked in eerie twilight, neither day nor night.
  - 'Under the Veil''s shroud, dreams and nightmares merge into one, and the boundaries
    between reality and the surreal blur like an artist''s forgotten canvas. '
  - In the embrace of the Veil, the ordinary becomes extraordinary, but beware, for
    secrets buried in the deepest corners of the heart shall surface in the unearthly
    half-light.
  - 'As the Veil unfurls, the world''s true nature will be revealed, and mankind
    must confront its own duality, grappling with the balance of light and darkness
    within. '
  - 'When the Veil descends, the ancient spirits stir, whispering forgotten truths
    to those who dare listen, but the price of such knowledge may be more than one
    can bear. '
