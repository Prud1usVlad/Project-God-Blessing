  prophesies:
  - In the depths of night, as stars fade into obscurity, you shall hear the haunting
    echoes of lost dreams, a reminder of aspirations left unfulfilled
  - ' Like a ghostly refrain, the echoes of lost dreams shall follow your every stride,
    a relentless chorus of missed opportunities and forsaken hopes. '
  - Your path shall be illuminated by the shattered remnants of forgotten dreams,
    casting a melancholic light upon the road you tread
  - The world around you shall become a tapestry woven from the threads of lost dreams,
    a mosaic of what could have been but never was
  - As you sleep, the echoes of lost dreams shall haunt your slumber, revealing glimpses
    of the destinies that might have been, but now remain forever out of reach
