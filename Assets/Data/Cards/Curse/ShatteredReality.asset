  prophesies:
  - 'With the curse of Shattered Reality, the world around you shall fracture into
    a kaleidoscope of broken truths, where nothing is as it seems, and reality dances
    on the precipice of madness. '
  - 'Under the weight of the Shattered Reality, the boundaries of existence shall
    crumble, and you shall wander through a labyrinth of fractured dimensions, where
    each step brings you further from the truth. '
  - 'The curse shall turn your perception into a shattered mirror, reflecting a myriad
    of distorted possibilities and fragmented destinies, leaving you lost in a maze
    of uncertainty. '
  - As the Shattered Reality unfolds, the very laws of nature shall bend and break,
    and the world shall become a canvas for the chaos of unrestrained imagination,
    where nightmares and dreams coalesce.
  - ' Your mind shall be the epicenter of the Shattered Reality, and its relentless
    onslaught shall test the limits of your sanity, forcing you to question the very
    nature of existence itself.'
