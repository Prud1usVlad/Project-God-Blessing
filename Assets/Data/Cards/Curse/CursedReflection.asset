  prophesies:
  - Your reflection shall become a twisted mirror, revealing the darkest facets of
    your soul, and every glance shall be a tormenting revelation.
  - " With the curse of the Cursed Reflection, your very essence shall be entwined
    with a malevolent doppelg\xE4nger, a shadow self that seeks to undermine and
    destroy you. "
  - 'The curse shall turn your own reflection into a betrayer, and it shall whisper
    deceitful truths that lead you down a treacherous and perilous path. '
  - 'As you gaze upon your reflection, it shall be as though you are peering into
    a realm of suffering and despair, for the Cursed Reflection shows only the agony
    within. '
  - 'Your reflection shall become a haunting specter of your past, showing you the
    haunting memories and regrets you can never escape, a relentless tormentor of
    your conscience. '
